# ESP8266 Based input redirection for the Nintendo 3DS
  
Control your 2DS/3DS using Luma3DS's input redirection, an ESP8266, and an NES controller!  
This is either a work in progress, or I'll get bored and give up fairly quickly.  
  
You probably need a level shifter for this, the rough hookup guide is in "nes_hookup.png"  
  
## Note:
It's been a while since I touched C++ since I'm normally in C land, if I am doing terrible, unspeakable things please let me know!
